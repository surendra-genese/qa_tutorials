      So that I can decide what to include on my product roadmap.

    Acceptance criteria for that user story could be:

        Scenario: The product manager adds potential ideas and ranks the best ideas based on benefit versus cost.

        Given that I have added two or more ideas and scored them using the Benefit vs Cost scoring model

        When I click the Rank button

        Then ideas are sorted with the top-scoring ideas at the top.
